# test-gemini-game




This repo is a collection of games Gemini 2.5 Pro (preview) I/O 05-12-25 Edition and I have collaborated on after a couple of hours each.
The goal of this repo is to identify the current abilities of SOTA AI in low-friction creation of functional coding projects, like simple web games.
Each game was initially coded entirely with Gemini through my prompting and suggestions.

The games are likely full of bugs and are more proof-of-concept as to the current status of AI than functioning games or a demonstration of my personal skill.

In addition to using Gemini to help create the games and scripts, I now use OpenAI's Codex-1 Research Preview to identify and fix bugs throughout the repo.
